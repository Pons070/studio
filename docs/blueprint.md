## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm, inviting orange (#F2A663) to evoke a sense of appetite and comfort.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated peach (#F8E9DA), lighter than the primary to create a welcoming, clean aesthetic.
- Accent color: Muted coral (#E07A5F), slightly analogous to the primary, used sparingly for call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif that offers an elegant and contemporary feel, suitable for headlines and body text.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent menu categories and user actions.
- A grid-based layout that allows easy scanning, a seamless flow between different actions, and effective spacing so that elements will pop out to the eye in the right places.
- Subtle transitions and animations to acknowledge user interactions and provide feedback, such as a smooth card flip on the menu or a brief loading animation on button clicks.
